//: ## Challenge
//: Explain out loud in English what the following code does. This is not a joke. Actually read it out loud and explain it in a way a lay person can understand. This is an actual coding process called [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). If it helps, you may use an actual rubber duck, stuffed animal, or action figure. No other toys are allowed, though! (Okay, that last part was a joke. You can use any toy)


let isTired = Bool.random()

if isTired {
	print("Go to sleep.")
} else {
	print("You can sleep when you're dead. Party on!")
}
