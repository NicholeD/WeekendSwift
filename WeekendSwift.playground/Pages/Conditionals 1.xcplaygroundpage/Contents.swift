//: ### Challenge
//: Wrap logic around these statements. Make it so that when `amHungry` is true, the phrase "Go eat a meal" is printed, but when `amHungry` is false, instead the phrase "Time for dessert... Go eat ice cream!" is printed.

let amHungry = false // feel free to change this value to test different paths

print("Go eat a meal")

print("Time for dessert... Go eat ice cream!")
